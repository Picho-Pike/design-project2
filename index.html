        <h2>Beware and Warning!</h2>
        <p id="p1">This story is different from other stories. You and YOU ALONE are in charge of what happens next. <br>
            There are dangers, choices, adventures and consequences. The wrong decision could end in disaster, - even DEATH. <br>
            But, don’t despair. At anytime YOU can go back and make another choice, alter the path of your story, and change its results. <br>
