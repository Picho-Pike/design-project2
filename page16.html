            <p>"We will wait until dark, then climb up the western wall and jump into the courtyard." Mark say as you eat some jerky, waiting for the sun to set. "No Mark," You disagree, "We should use the willow tree on the northern side." "That tree won't be able to hold our weight, think with your head! it'll crack underneath us." "Then we'll go one at a time," You answer. "I'm not going to put my faith in a tree!" Mark replies angrily. <b>Should you go along with Mark's plan or should you double down on your own?</b></p>
