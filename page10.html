            <p>Wandering through the rich section of the city, you are amazed at how vastly different the two social classes are. The poor have shoddily built wooden houses stacked one on top of each other, front doors leading out into alleyways and the constant threat of crime guild forcing them to pay for protection. But the rich lords and ladies of the city have it all; towering houses of evenly placed stone bricks, front gates with armed guards positioned outside and roofs of quartzite. But by far the most lavish and expensive house in the city, the baron's estate. With three floors, a central tower, and a stone wall with a gatehouse, the baron's abode is almost twice the size of any building in the city, even the Spear's Embrace hideout doesn't come close to a third of the size! You and Mark decide that you'll do some recon now and wait until the cover of dark to retrieve the diadem.</p>
