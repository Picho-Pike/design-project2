            <p>"We're going up the tree, Mark. This is a stealth mission and I am superior in this field." "Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you." Mark responds. You feel very good about yourself and the future of the mission and wait until the sun has dipped below the horizon before starting towards the weeping willow. "I'll go first Mark." You say confidently as you grab onto several thick strands. "This will never work." Mark mumbles, but he too grabs several strands and starts the climb. The beginning of the climb is the most difficult you find, but after the strands thicken considerably it doesn't take too much effort. You and Mark get to the top and scout out the garden within. Below there are pathways of stone criss-crossing flowerbeds of white, yellow, and red. towards the east there is what looks to be a garden shed and a few servants dot the pathways. "I told you this wasn't a good plan," Mark says in his signature sense of superiority. "Whatever," You say. "We can easily slip past these gardeners." You survey the paths you could take and slip down the trunk of the tree. <em>Left, right, straight, left then left again, You say to yourself.</em></p>
