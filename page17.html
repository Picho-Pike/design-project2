            <p>"Fine." You answer. "If you can't put your faith in a tree then we'll just have to do your plan." "Excellent." Mark says smugly, "I knew you'd see my point of view." You grit your teeth but say nothing as you wait until the sun disappears from view. You and Mark silently go to the western wall and attempt to climb the wall. The going is slow and you nearly fall twice, but in the end, you make it up the 15 foot tall wall and slip down to the other side. "That wasn't so difficult," you say as you rest against the wall. "See, I told you, way safer than climbing the tree." Mark responds. You make your way over to the immense manor and once again, climb up a stone surface. This time though, you have it easier as the fancy windows provide excellent foot holds. you reach the second floor and take advantage of a small balcony in front of a window to rest up.</p>
