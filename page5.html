            <p>You and Mark journey through the winding pathways of Vivaria, passing through poor districts and even poorer ones. You round the bend and find yourself in the lower class market. Stalls full with peasants and merchants alike. Poor men and women litter the stinking, sweaty stalls, looking for the next rich customer who could give them and their family enough money for their evening meal in a few hours. But in a poor district, none exist. Mark scrunches up his nose and takes off down the street quickly, but you catch sight of a particularly fat and richly dressed merchant who has a pouch of money sticking loosely at his waist. You could easily snatch the money, but there seems to be a lot of eyes looking at this round fellow.<b>Should you risk the steal, or follow Mark and scurry out of this dump before someone marks you for an easy steal?</b></p>
