            <p>"Of course," you say, as you walk down the right corridor towards the armory. You turn a corner, walk down a flight of stairs and into the Spear's Embrace's armory. The walls have racks on racks of flashy weapons; halberds, axes, crossbows and the like. Mark goes straight for a sword and grabs a belt with a few daggers on it. Knowing discretion to be the best option, you opt for two well concealed knives, one at your waist and one in your boot. How foolish would it have been to go to a well guarded manor house without weapons? you probably would be captured and executed without any means of self-defense. After gearing up you and Mark depart the guild's hideout and take off towards the manor house, which sits squarely on the top of a hill looking out at the northern city gate.</p>
