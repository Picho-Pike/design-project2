            <p>You and Mark skirt around the mansion with caution, you were right when you said it was stealth mission. You note a few key flaws in the security of the estate. For starters, the only consistenty placed guards are at the front gate. There is also a weeping willow in the back garden that droops over the wall. And the most ridiculous thing is how easy it would be to climb to the second floor using the fancy windows. You chuckle to yourself, this will be one of the easiest heist you've ever pulled off.</p>
