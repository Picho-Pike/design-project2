            <p>You reach over and tap the merchant on the shoulder. "Excuse me but you might want to leave here." The Merchant turns towards you in annoyance, "Begone, I may shop wherever I deem fit." "But those thugs don't believe so," you say, pointing over his shoulder. The merchant follows your finger and starts when he sees the armed men walking towards him. "I think I shall be going!" Declares the frightened merchant, scurrying along in the opposite direction of the thugs. You watch him as he weaves by peasants and finally around a corner, disappearing from sight. You look over your shoulder as the street thugs speed their way past the stall, chasing after the man. You resume your journey towards the Baron's abode, hurrying to catch up to Mark. After a while, you leave the poorer district behind and venture towards the rich, the tops of their houses gleaming in the late afternoon sun.</p>
